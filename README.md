# Chord Display

<p style="color: red; font-weight: bold">This project is no longer maintained.</p>
<p style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Due to Windows MIDI drivers being exclusive, and OBS not supporting WebMidi, I started a new project as a standalone app that includes a chord-display module.</p>
<p style="color: red; font-weight: bold">You can find it here: <a href="https://github.com/la-jarre-a-son/midi-jar">MIDI Jar</a></p>

A free tool to show chords and notes being played using a MIDI keyboard.

## Where ?

You can use this tool online at [https://chord-display.rednet.io](https://chord-display.rednet.io) or [Download ZIP](https://github.com/rednetio/chord-display/archive/master.zip) and open the file `dist/index.html` directly.

## Why ?

I was searching for a VST or any software that can show me the chords while I (or anybody jamming with me) play on a screen.
And I was unable to find any good solution, so I created this free tool.
It is very simple and very customizable, since it's based on the Web MIDI API now supported by all modern browsers.

You can use it for streaming on Twitch by including it as a BrowserSource in OBS (Open Broadcast Software), Streamlabs OBS or for your Youtube videos.
Do not hesitate to mention it in your channel and video description.

## Customize

You can customize Chord Display without knowing much about programming.

### via CSS

OBS BrowserSource let you inject any CSS in the page, so you can add any style to existing layout, like:

Remove detected Chord:

```css
#chord {
  display: none;
}
```

Remove Bass Note / Slash chord / Compound chord notation:

```css
.bassnote {
  display: none;
}
```

Remove played Notes:

```css
#notes {
  display: none;
}
```

Remove keyboard:

```css
#keyboard {
  display: none;
}
```

Change Keyboard colors:

```css
.note.white.active .piano-key {
  fill: #ecb2ab;
}

.note.black.active .piano-key {
  fill: #bf3a2b;
}
```

Remove tonic dots:

```css
.piano-tonic {
  display: none;
}
```

Add a background to the keyboard:

```css
#keyboard {
  padding: 32px;
  background: url('http://cdn.backgroundhost.com/backgrounds/subtlepatterns/bo_play_pattern.png')
    repeat;
}
```

Change display order:

```css
#keyboard {
  order: 1;
}
#chordContainer {
  order: 2;
}
#notes {
  order: 3;
}
```

Change Text Color:

```css
body {
  color: #fff;
}
```

Change Note Highlight Colors:

```css
.note.white {
  color: #ff4444;
}
.note.black {
  color: #ff0000;
}
```

Change chord size and placement:

```css
#chordContainer {
  align-items: flex-end;
  justify-content: flex-end;
  padding: 2vh;
}

#chord {
  font-size: 10vh;
}

#notes {
  display: none;
}
```

### via Settings in Query Params

Settings are passed throught URL query params (urlencoded), and let you customize some features that might need programmatical changes.
When using Chord Display with a standard web browser, on mouse over, the settings sections appears.
Any changes to settings are reflected in URL, and will be kept on refresh.

To persist those settings, favorite the page, or copy/paste it in OBS BrowserSource to use the same settings.

With settings you can:
